I am currently a second year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. 

I am broadly interested in NLP and ML. In particular, I am interested in LLM Agents, training LLMs for software engineering tasks, and studying the safety and robustness of LLMs, Agents, ML algorithms. I am also open to exploring new interesting research directions.

At CMU, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Graham Neubig](https://phontron.com/) and [Prof. Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2024, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Animesh Mukherjee](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/), [Prof. Somak Aditya](https://adityasomak.github.io/) and [Prof. Mainack Mondal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~mainack/), where I was awarded the Institute Endowment Prize for securing the second-highest GPA among all graduating Bachelor's students.

In addition to research, I have previously interned at Nutanix as a ML Researcher in the AI/ML team and at Google as a software developer. For more details, please check my CV or feel free to contact me at [adityabs@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:adityabs@cs.cmu.edu).
